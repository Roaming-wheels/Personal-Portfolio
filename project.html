<h1><center>Content Based Image Retrieval System</center></h1>
<p><h3>Content-based image retrieval, also known as query by image content (QBIC) and content-based visual information retrieval (CBVIR), is the application of computer vision techniques to the image retrieval problem, that is, the problem of searching for digital images in large databases (see this survey for a scientific overview of the CBIR field). Content-based image retrieval is opposed to traditional concept-based approaches (see Concept-based image indexing).</h3></p>
<p><h3>"Content-based" means that the search analyzes the contents of the image rather than the metadata such as keywords, tags, or descriptions associated with the image. The term "content" in this context might refer to colors, shapes, textures, or any other information that can be derived from the image itself. CBIR is desirable because searches that rely purely on metadata are dependent on annotation quality and completeness.</h3></p>
<p><h2> Application of CBIR:</h2>
<h3>Content-based image retrieval (CBIR) is the most important area for computer visible and image processing. This was used in different fields such as medicine, health, cultural heritage, crime prevention, and so forth. CBIR is a well-defined image search and retrieval technique based on its visual content within a large collection of data. Retrieval of images is characterized by local or global characteristics that rely on visual details. The image properties, such as color, form, and texture, describe the global characteristics. </h3></p>
